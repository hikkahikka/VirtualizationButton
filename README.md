# Introduction
This application was created to comfortably switch the virtualization status on Windows.

## Why is this necessary?
It often happens that for anti-cheat applications to work correctly, they require turning off virtualization for correct operation, while it is necessary to start a virtual machine.
My application will help you switch the virtualization status in the Windows system without running the console and system registry.

## How do I launch the application?
1. You need to install the latest release version of the project.
2. Unpack the zip archive.
3. Launch the application.exe.

## Attention!
1. Administrator rights are required to run the application.
2. Virtualization can only be enabled if it is enabled in the bios settings, otherwise you will see a notification that the status cannot be changed.
3. It is required to restart your computer after making any changes.
